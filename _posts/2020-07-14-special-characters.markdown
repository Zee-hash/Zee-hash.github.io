> I need some characters when I edit the document.  

In fact, recently I always use the "Characters" that comes with the gnome desktop environment, but sometimes I canâ€™t find the required character for a long time. So I record some character key words that took me a long time to find The name.  
The reason I need this is that some symbols I have seen but I do not know their correct names.

Skills:  
+ `Super(win)` + `A` to show all applications.  
+ Input the keyword.  
+ `Enter` to copy the character you find.

> I need some characters when I edit the document.  

In fact, recently I always use the "Characters" that comes with the gonme desktop environment, but sometimes I canâ€™t find them for a long time. So I record some character key words that took me a long time to find The name.
The reason I need this is because some symbols I have seen but I do not know their correct names.

Skills:  
+ `super(win)` + `A` to show all applications  
+ input the keyword.  
+ `Enter` for copy the character you find.
